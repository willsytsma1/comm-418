# Border Patrol Data Reveals Markedly Less Violent Year in Most Violent Sector

The U.S. Border Patrol sector known for using the most force against civilians and detainees reported its least violent year in the past three fiscal years, public data shows.

The Tucson Sector in Southern Arizona, whose agents' uses of force have accounted for over a fifth of all Border Patrol reports since the beginning of fiscal year 2023, reported only 108 uses of force in fiscal year 2025, according to use of force data available on the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol's website. The data stems from reports that agents submit to CBP. 

That number still represents the highest reported uses of force out of any of the Border Patrol's sectors last fiscal year. But the sector which reported the second most, San Diego, trailed by only one report.

The Tuscon Sector's decline in reported uses of force follows a three-year-long trend across nearly all of the Border Patrol's 20 sectors and "Special Operation Group." Agency wide, Border Patrol agents reported using force over 20% fewer times last fiscal year compared to fiscal year 2024. The decline between fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024 was even greater.

Incidents that require agents to report use of force can vary from less-lethal force —— like laying hands on a person, or deploying a less-than-lethal weapons like a baton or chemical device —— to using vehicle-immoblization devices on a moving vehicle, to shooting their firearm at someone, according to CBP's Use of Force Policy. 

But no single "type," or level, of force accounted for Tucson's reported decline. Tucson agents reported using less force across all categories. They reported no firearm-related incidents last fiscal year.

It's important to note that reporting can be affected by the level of oversight implemented over agents, which can be impacted by each presidential adminstration's policy. [Need comment from expert on oversight, ideally a former CBP OPR person.]

It remains to be seen whether this trend will hold, especially as President Donald Trump has amped up federal operations across the country. Already in fiscal year 2026, which started on Oct. 1, Border Patrol agents have reported using force over 200 times nationally. In the Tucson sector, agents have reported 28. Tucson agents have already reported one firearm incident this fiscal year.

*Note: The original CBP dataset includes data from multiple arms of CBP, including Air and Marine Operations and the Office of Field Operations as well as the Border Patrol. To isolate reports from Border Patrol Agents, I first sorted the "Component" column so that all BP reports were together. I manually copied those lines into a new tab, and double checked the number I had copied over to ensure that I capture all present BP reports and none from agents or officers in different components.*

*Then, I created pivot tables to look at data from different sectors over the years, as well as a number of other combinations of data points. When I saw the trend in Tucson, I  used a filter function (which I remembered existed after I did the first step manually) to isolate only Tucson reports into a new tab. I then made a pivot table from the Tucson-only data to look at force type in particular without the noise of other sectors' data on the page. That combination of pivot tables became the data used above.*
