# FOIA-ing MPD response time data

Metropolitan Police Department team:

This is a request under the D.C. Freedom of Information Act, D.C. Code § 2-531 et seq.

I am requesting copies of records or datasets that indicate the response times to all Metropolitan Police Department calls for service in minutes by MPD police district for calendars years 2020 through 2025. I am requesting them in .pdf format if they appear as reports or documents, and in .csv or .xlsx format if they appear as datasets.

Per page 214 the D.C. Auditor’s Sept. 12, 2024 report entitled “MPD Needs Improved Data Analysis, Targeted Deployment, and More Detectives,” I know that MPD tracks its response times to calls for service. 

As I am requesting these records as a journalism student in the interest of the public, with the intent to pursue publication of these records, I kindly request a waiver of any fees associated with this request. I am an editor for AWOL student media organization, a long-form investigative newspaper that works to teach student reporters how to shed light on American University’s campus activities and the District of Columbia’s municipal activities. These records will aid in the public’s understanding of MPD’s response time across the district.

If there are still fees, please send me a quote to this email address prior to beginning work.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.

Sincerely,
Will Sytsma
