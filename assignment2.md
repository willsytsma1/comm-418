The question I'm choosing to answer with data is: "How does the number of uses of force by Border Patrol agents during the last fiscal year (2025) stack up against years prior."

Part of the reason I chose this question is that I know that *most* law enforcement agencies are required to report use of force data, and often have it publishable on their website. So, I went directly to CBP.gov, and surely enough I found a use of force dashboard under "Assault and Use of Force Statistics." 

A number of factors make the dataset, at least in my view, reliable. The first is that the data are coming directly from the agency. All things equal, the data they're looking at is aggregated from the reports they've received from their own officers and agents, meaning that there's minimal room for reported incidents to get lost in upload process. The less the steps, the less room for error, at least in theory. The second is that there are laws and policies mandating CBP to report this data. This doesn't mean it's 100% accurate, but it does mean there's a greater burden on them for accuracy. Individual agents are also required to report their uses of force per a CBP-wide policy, meaning there's a high chance of accuracy at the collection level. To vet the actual data on the dashboard myself, I downloaded the full dataset available in CBP's data locker and spot checked the aggregated cells visible online, choosing cells at random from across years. The data did check out.

Generally, law enforcement data is fairly trustworthy. A consideration that users of this dataset should take into account, though, is that use of force reporting is heavily based on the mood of an administration in terms of accountability. With Trump in office, agents may feel less inclined to report less-lethal or less serious uses of force. That could account for low numbers in 2025. So, while use of force datasets may never fully encapsulate the entire universe of uses of force, even under an administration with a greater accountability emphasis, we need to be extra cognizant of reporting limitations for 2025 and the few available months for 2026.
