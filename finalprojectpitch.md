The Department of Homeland Security's social media accounts have taken on a starkly accusatory tone under the second Trump administration. Officials' use of social media has come under fire in assault cases like that of Marimar Martinez in Chicago. FBI Director Kash Patel reposted bystander a video of an alleged assault incorrectly attributed to Martinez, causing a DHS spokeperson to publicly clarify that the video was not of Martinez, but not without accusing both her and the video's subject of federal crimes.

But perhaps even more alarmingly, officials have used the department's official government accounts to post the photos of people who they are targetting in Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Operations, alleging past convictions of a mix of serious crimes to traffic violations. Evidence, whether through court documents or even just case numbers, don't accompany their posts. And no one has *really* checked those claims yet. Can DHS officials be trusted to post accurate information about the people whose faces they're putting into the public eye? Or are they bringing serious allegations of criminality against immigrants that are unsupportable and unlitigated?
