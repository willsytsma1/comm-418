# The San Francisco Chronicle's "San Francisco crime rates hit historic lows — except in these 2 neighborhoods"

The Chronicle used crime data from the San Fransisco Police Department to show that, despite what they called historic lows in the city's overall crime rate, two neighborhoods experienced increases in crime. The data show that larceny accounts for the increases in the SoMa and Mission Bay neighborhoods, according to the Chronicle's analysis.

I appreciated the Chronicle's use of interactive graphics to maximize readers' engagement with the story. Their color-coded crime maps allow readers to filter by crime type, show detailed data for each neighborhood and zoom in and out with at their will. I also appreciated how thorough the Chronicle's reporters were in presenting readers with a full analysis. They examined how reporting practices contributed to stark increases in the two neighborhoods, narrowing in on how one Target location made an intersection account for around a third of all larceny reports in the entire neighborhood. They did the same for an intersection in Mission Bay. Such detailed analysis is always important when presenting crime data, which when underdescribed can make people fearful of certain neighborhoods, perpetuate geographic stereotypes and impact business.

But the reporters' detailed analysis was also one of their faults.
