# The San Francisco Chronicle's "San Francisco crime rates hit historic lows — except in these 2 neighborhoods"

The Chronicle used crime data from the San Fransisco Police Department to show that, despite what they called historic lows in the city's overall crime rate, two neighborhoods experienced increases in crime in 2025. The data show that larceny accounts for the increases in the SoMa and Mission Bay neighborhoods, according to the Chronicle's analysis.

I appreciated the Chronicle's use of interactive graphics to maximize readers' engagement with the story. Their color-coded crime maps allow readers to filter by crime type, show detailed data for each neighborhood and zoom in and out with at their will. I also appreciated how thorough the Chronicle's reporters were in presenting readers with a full analysis. They examined how reporting practices contributed to stark increases in the two neighborhoods, narrowing in on how one Target location made an intersection account for around a third of all larceny reports in the entire neighborhood. They did the same for an intersection in Mission Bay. Such detailed analysis is always important when presenting crime data, which when underdescribed can make people fearful of certain neighborhoods, perpetuate geographic stereotypes and impact business.

But the reporters' detailed analysis was also one of their faults. Many of their grafs are bogged down by loads of numbers that, after a while, begin to lose any significant meaning. I always learned that data was meant to be one of many tools in a reporter's toolbelt, not the only one. Aarushi's famous 8-digit maximum rule exists for a reason — grafs that are too numbers-heavy become onerous to read and understand. What's more, several times the reporters referred to increases in percentages over 100%, which can be difficult for readers who aren't numbers-savvy to understand. Many people don't know that the 600% increase the reporters reference at one point in their writing actually indicated that the number of reports increased by seven times, not six. Data reporting should make numbers accessible to readers of all expertises and should connect numbers to the people affected by them. I suggest the Chronicle puts down its abbacus and finds some folks who crime increases in SoMa and Mission Bay may have impacted. Or has the mayor or a public official bragged about crime decreases? If so, why haven't they factored these two areas into their rhetoric? There are a number of ways the reporters could have better put the data into actual context.
