The data these reporters have compiled is impressive and cohesive. I appreciate that their visualizations descend in order of specicity, giving readers the nutgraf through their first viz. However, I wonder if the graphics they use oversaturate the amount of information the reader is given. The second graphic, in particular, is more specific but still perhaps redunant of the first.

Similarly, I question whether we need all of the information they provide in the larger, district-specific graphic. Could some of it have been pulled out or explained in written form?
