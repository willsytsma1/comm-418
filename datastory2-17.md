# ProPublica and the Texas Tribune's "'Not Ready for Prime Time.' A Federal Tool to Check Voter Citizenship Keeps Making Mistakes."

This story is interesting because, not only does it use data, but it's about government data collection. The story goes beyond data to get at the areas where USCIS' practice of cross-referencing different government systems can lead to errors in their identification of non-citizens who are registered to vote and the proportion of the voting population they claim are voting non-citizens.

My one qualm is with the different data sources the reporters use. They cite data they've obtained from elections officials, but also a survey that was rather inconclusive. All of their numbers are helpful, in theory, but together they make the story a little bit hard to track. They also switch between scales — county, state, nation. I feel like their writing and structure could have been even slightly tweaked to better highlight the numbers they have and what they really say about the problem at hand.
