# "Old media" still a favorite among COMM-418 students
Data from the class survey administered today shows that the vast majority of students in spring semester "Data-Driven Journalism" are interested in written articles. Though many also expressed an interest in multimedia content — audio, visual and graphics stories — only one student did not list written content as one of their interests.

Of the 18 students:
<ul> 
<li>Those who listed written articles as an interest comprised over 94% of the class.</li>
<li>Two-thirds of students listed graphics content as an interest of theirs.</li>
<li>Nearly half (over 44%) listed audio content as an interest.</li>
<li>One-third of students listed visual content.</li> 
</ul>

High levels of interest in graphics content does not come as a surprise, since students inclined to take a data journalism class can be expected to be interested in graphics content. But the overwhelming majority of students still interested in written content, given a decades-long <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/people-are-turning-away-news-heres-why-it-may-be-happening">decline</a> in popular consumption of written journalism, might. The survey's results suggest that even journalism students interested in "new" forms of consuming media might still give hope to a struggling industry.
