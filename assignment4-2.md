# Cataloguing Jersey City's Officer-Involved Deaths

There are many comprehensive datasets detailing use of force. But police-involved deaths are much harder to track. I spent the summer reporting on mental-health related uses of force from a statewide dataset that I trimmed down to encompass only incidents in Jersey City, New Jersey. The story came out of a mental-health-related police killing — the person's death was well-documented in the media and in publicized body cam footage. But the dataset, which is the only UOF dataset that contains data about the Jersey City Police Department, wasn't coded to indicate that the subject had died.

The question guiding my reporting/data gathering: how many officer-involved deaths have there been in Jersey City in the past five years? No one is really, comprehensively at least, tracking these incidents. Our publication would be the first to conduct this accountability reporting.

Race, gender, and location would be three essential points I would want to track. In the UOF dataset, there were a disproportionate number of Black men who were subjects of the incidents I was looking at. I suspect a similar trend will present itself among those killed. Moreover, I want to know if the socio-economic or racial makeup of the areas where any killings are happening yields any particular trends.

I would harness the power of Google and social media to find clips and other documentation of any killings. For social media posts that claim a death, I would confirm with the city or county spokeperson. This would be the only real help I would need in collecting and verifying data.
